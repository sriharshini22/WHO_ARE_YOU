This is a web application for the MBTI Personality Test.

The Myers–Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is an introspective self-report questionnaire indicating differing psychological preferences in how people perceive the world and make decisions. It enjoys popularity despite being widely regarded as pseudoscience by the scientific community. The test attempts to assign a binary value to each of four categories: introversion or extraversion, sensing or intuition, thinking or feeling, and judging or perceiving. One letter from each category is taken to produce a four-letter test result, such as "ISTJ" or "ENFP".

Through a series of questions, the MBTI assessment helps you identify your natural preferences in four areas of personality:
How do you direct and receive energy—by focusing on the outside world, interacting with people, and taking action, or by focusing on your inner world and reflecting on ideas, memories, and experiences?
How do you take in information—by focusing on what you perceive using your five senses or by seeing the big picture and looking for relationships and patterns? 
How do you decide and come to conclusions—by logically analyzing the situation or by considering what’s important to the people involved?
How do you approach the outside world—in a planned, orderly way or a more flexible, spontaneous way? 
Your natural preferences in these four areas sort you into one of 16 distinct MBTI personality types. Understanding these types gives you objective insight that you can use to enhance your professional and personal relationships, as well as your direction, focus, and choices. 

The Myers-Briggs Types
Each type is then listed by its four-letter code:

ISTJ - The Inspector: Reserved and practical, they tend to be loyal, orderly, and traditional.
ISTP - The Crafter: Highly independent, they enjoy new experiences that provide first-hand learning.
ISFJ - The Protector: Warm-hearted and dedicated, they are always ready to protect the people they care about.
ISFP - The Artist: Easy-going and flexible, they tend to be reserved and artistic.
INFJ - The Advocate: Creative and analytical, they are considered one of the rarest Myers-Briggs types.
INFP - The Mediator: Idealistic with high values, they strive to make the world a better place.
INTJ - The Architect: High logical, they are both very creative and analytical.
INTP - The Thinker: Quiet and introverted, they are known for having a rich inner world.
ESTP - The Persuader: Outgoing and dramatic, they enjoy spending time with others and focusing on the here and now.
ESTJ - The Director: Assertive and rule-oriented, they have high principles and a tendency to take charge.
ESFP - The Performer: Outgoing and spontaneous, they enjoy taking center stage.
ESFJ - The Caregiver: Soft-hearted and outgoing, they tend to believe the best about other people.
ENFP - The Champion: Charismatic and energetic, they enjoy situations where they can put their creativity to work. 
ENFJ - The Giver: Loyal and sensitive, they are known for being understanding and generous.
ENTP - The Debater: Highly inventive, they love being surrounded by ideas and tend to start many projects (but may struggle to finish them).
ENTJ - The Commander: Outspoken and confident, they are great at making plans and organizing projects.

The MBTI is just one approach to personality typing. Personality typing refers to systems that categorize people based on their traits, tendencies, and other characteristics. Other popular types of personality tests include:

1. The Enneagram
2. The Five Love Languages
3. The Big Five Personality Assessment
4. The Workplace DISC Test
5. Cattell's 16 Personality Factor Questionnaire

However, the Myers-Briggs types differ in some important ways. First, the MBTI is not really a "test." There are no right or wrong answers, and one type is not better than any other type. The purpose of the indicator is not to evaluate mental health or offer any type of diagnosis.

Also, unlike many other psychological evaluations, your results are not compared against any norms. Instead of looking at your score in comparison to other people's results, the instrument's goal is to simply offer further information about your unique personality.
